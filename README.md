# Hi, I'm V

- Aspiring Gameplay Systems Designer
- Currently learning Unreal Engine 5 & C++

I'm transitioning into game development with a focus on building structured, scalable gameplay systems and psychologically driven mechanics.

My goal is to design systems that create tension, moral complexity, and meaningful player choice. 

## Current Focus: 
- Unreal Engine 5 ; Blueprints & C++
- Core gameplay systems architecture
- AI behavoir and decision systems
- Player-driven branching mechanics
- Clean, readable C++ fundamentals

## Tech Stack:
- C++
- Unreal Engine 5
- Git & GitHub
- Blueprint Visual Scripting

## Featured Projects

### Systems-based Narrative Prototype
A gameplay prototype exploring: 
- Task driven pressure loops
- Hidden information discovery 
- Escalating moral evaluation systems
- Multiple branching endings
*(In development, dev logs coming soon)*

## Connect
More updates coming soon as I build and document my journey
